            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This Chair is Not a Chair is a design project that challenges the idea of what a chair can be. This project blurs the line between a chair and a beautiful work of art. This project had a size limitation of 50 cm³. With no other limitations, I was able to be as creative as possible. This project tested my abilities to conceptualize, sketch, and apply my innovative skill through a 3D model. </p>

          <h3>Design Process</h3>
          <div class="bottom-border-white"></div>
          <p>This Chair is Not a Chair is a school project that required me to think outside the box by creating a chair that can be seen as both art and function. While brainstorming for what would make an interesting chair and sculpture, I made sure to not distance myself from the traditional four-legged chair or any of its variations. I looked at the natural world around me, taking inspiration from objects and animals. 
            Eventually, I designed a version of the chair that would guide the project in a newfound direction. The design takes inspiration from a snake head, with the contour of the skull as the seat of the chair. The tongue of the snake provides additional support for the chair to prevent collapsing. I had ideas of designing the mouth of the snake as the seat but found that the natural contour of the skull helped me convey both the shape of a chair, as well as the shape of a snake.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The final design of my chair takes inspiration from a snake's head. Using the head of the snake to signify a chair, it was important for me to convey both the context of a chair and an art piece. After completing the sketches and laying out the foundation of my design, I took my design into Rhinoceros3D where I transformed my sketch into a 3D model.   </p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            While designing the chair, it was crucial to remember that the final product will be assembled as a slotted cardboard model, rather than a smooth 3D print. This was a challenge because it meant that we could not include fine details, as they would fall off from our model. 
Another challenge was how we needed to convey both the fact that the model is a chair and a piece of art, as the two ideas are contradictory. Art is typically not meant to be touched, and a chair is an item that is touched for the entirety of its lifespan. We needed to bridge these two ideas together, creating a cohesive model that has the affordances of a chair.  </p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <div class="bottom-border-white"></div>
          <p>This Chair is Not a Chair was a challenging project that required ingenuity to design something both artistic, as well as functional. Because the final assembly of the project was slotted, there was a lot of thought put into the overall shape of the head, ensuring that it was still identifiable in the end. I am especially proud of the fact that, due to the large features of the design, it is very structurally sound. </p>
