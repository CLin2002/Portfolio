                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Pavillion In a Park is a school project where I was tasked to design a pavilion and pergola within the boundaries of Holland Park in Surrey, British Columbia. I was given the option to create a pavilion for either the purpose of music recitals, religious practices, or celebratory purposes. I decided to design the pavilion for hosting music recitals, specifically the piano.  
                    Because Holland Park has a finite area, I was given a size restriction for the pavilion and pergola. I had to learn how to consider maximizing the space I am provided, while also creating a visually engaging design that served its purpose as a music recital space.</p>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <div class="bottom-border-white"></div>
            <p>Before I began designing, I first had to understand where the best placement for the pavilion and pergola would be. Working within a finite area means that I must consider where the most logical area would be. I first had to ask questions like: "should this be the main attraction of Holland Park?" or "how might placing the pavilion at busy intersections make people feel?". 
                Going forward with these questions in mind, I first designed a cylindrical pavilion made of glass. The reason I wanted to work with glass is that I chose a very open area, and wanted the entire park to be visible on the top floor of the pavilion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A consideration when designing the pergola was to ensure that, while it should be cohesive with the pavilion, it should also stand out on its own. I designed the pergola using lattices that used similar materials to the pavilion. I wanted to design lattices because they helped break up the strong, rigid shapes of the pavilion. Another aspect I wanted to consider when designing the pergola was to use of a round, parabolic shape. Designing with geometric shapes was too much of a contrast to the pavilion. </p>

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>A shortcoming I faced throughout this assignment is learning how to balance between aesthetically interesting shapes and real-world constraints. I wanted to design something creative and fun, however, I also wanted to retain a sense of realism. Although it was not required, I wanted to design a pavilion and pergola that looked believable and awe-inspiring. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Another challenge that I was faced with was symmetry. Due to the symmetrical shape of the pavilion, it became hard to design a pergola that looked balanced. This is where I started looking at the technicalities of the assignment, as the pergola was limited by total area, rather than a set quantity. </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Pavilion In a Park challenged my creativity while using real-world thinking to set restrictions. I am ecstatic that my initial design translated into the final product. More than just design, this project taught me about lighting, shadows, and materiality. I am glad that I was able to marry all three of those ideas into one cohesive piece of art and architecture. </p>
